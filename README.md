# dxf_2d_tool

Pre-employment Test for Flutter Developer
Objective: Develop a Flutter app replicating the functionality shown in the video here (between 15 and 20 seconds), allowing users to draw specific areas on a canvas and export the drawing to a DXF file.
Task Overview:
Clone Video Functionality: Recreate the interface and features shown in the video.
Menu Options: Implement three menu options:
New Kitchen Countertop: Draws rectangles 25.5 inches wide.
New Island: Draws rectangles 30 inches wide.
Export to DXF file: Export the canvas drawing to a DXF file.
Drawing:
Canvas Interaction: Drag to draw rectangles with fixed widths based on the menu selection (just like in the video above).  Also add the ability drag and drop the shapes to different parts of the canvas.  
Dynamic Measurement: Display dimensions while drawing, showing final dimensions once drawing is complete.
Bonus points: If the user wants to change the dimensions of a finished rectangle, they should be allowed to click one line, view a popup menu, then submit a new length.  The canvas should refresh the rectangle with the new length.   
Export and Share:
Export: Use a Dart DXF API (such as: https://pub.dev/documentation/dxf/latest/dxf/dxf-library.html) to export the drawing to a DXF file.
Share via Email: Allow users to share the DXF file via email.
Submission:
Code: Submit via a GitHub repository.
Demo Video: Provide a video showing the app running on your device or emulator.
Deadline: Thursday, June 27, 12 PM MST.
Evaluation:
Functionality: Meets specified requirements.
Code Quality: Clean and well-documented.
User Experience: Intuitive user-friendly and most importantly, the drawing is smooth and intuitive.  If the user draws multiple drawings, they should not overlap each other on the canvas.
Timeliness: Submitted by the deadline.
Good luck! Reach out with any questions.
